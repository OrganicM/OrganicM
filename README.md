- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OrganicM (MichaÅ‚)
- For most of my life (I'm 29) I've been staying away from coding due to fear and thinking that it's too difficult and you need to basically be a mathematician in order to do coding.
- The time has come to prove myself wrong and I've strongly decided to dive into coding head-first and overcome my fears.
